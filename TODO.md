# TODO

## General

- Change examples in README to a working API. Perhaps [magicthegathering.io](http://magicthegathering.io)?
- Switch to another arguments parser, probably [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js)
- More coverage. Mainly this involves testing ins and outs of config files, and maybe figuring something out for smart output.
- Document and test scripts returning non-objects (numbers, strings)
- Actually do something with verbosity (`-v`)
- More ES6ification: look for use cases for template strings, etc.

## New commands

- `jfold`: Like [Haskell's `foldr` and friends](https://wiki.haskell.org/Fold) - initial, iterative expression, reducer
